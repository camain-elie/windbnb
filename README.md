<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./public/project-overview.png)

My take on devchallenge.io's Windbnb challenge. I did it as a training project to get more confortable when using React. And sure I did. I learned a lot about React, especially about the events and rerenders of the components.

I also improved a bit in scss (and css) through this project.
